# QuadTree
Algorithm QuadTree to make grid more thick

"A quadtree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Quadtrees are the two-dimensional analog of octrees and are most often used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree]

Program is used to get random objects and make grid that is irregular (more thick on bordrs of objects).
